# About small mini Project (Automation with Python)
Here, I had created a small python project named transactSheet where i had used openpyxl(excel package file) imporrt and i had performed functions.Here, i had made one excel file and inserted that into my project
and what i had done next is i had accesseed that workbook, sheet and the cell of that sheet and thereafter i had imported BarChart and Reference so as to create a pie chart in our new excel sheet that i am 
generating from this python program.Thus, the operations i performed is you need to enter with which name you want the new excel file(.xlsx) and when user inputs that, then the new file in which i am adding 
features of displaying the corrected value by multiplying each cell value with 0.9 in the column next to it and thus also creates bar chart of that corrected values.

#How to run the Project - 
Step 1 : Create project and open terminal and write - pip install openpyxl (To install excel file package). 
Step 2 : Now copy and paste these folders and files after opening the project file location. 
Step 3 : Now run the main.py and there you need to enter the filename in .xlsx format to save to that new file otherwise will give an error.
Step 4 : That new excel file will be created and you can now see the updated excel file with values and barchart by opening that.


So, Thankyou for having a look at my this basic project desgined using Python programming langauge to implement excel files.
